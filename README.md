# Financial Times Technical Test

This repository contains my solution to the Financial Times Technical Test, which is divided into two exercises: retrieving stock data and building a UI component. Below, youâ€™ll find implementation details, setup instructions, testing documentation, and additional notes.

## **Overview**
### **Part 1: Retrieve the Data**
- Fetch data from the FT Securities Quotes API and display it in plain HTML.
- The data includes stock prices and percentage changes for symbols like FTSE 100 and S&P 500.

### **Part 2: Build the UI**
- Create a component based on the provided design and sample JSON.
- The component is styled, responsive, and accessible.
